    """The files the final reviewer may read: every business node's, deduped.

    The node owns nothing -- it aggregates -- so its `allowlist` stays empty.
    But dispatch derives a worker profile from `contract["files"]` and
    `validate_child_session_binding` refuses an empty allowlist, so a node with
    no files can never be handed to a reviewer session and every complex run
    stalls on it.  The union is also the honest scope: this reviewer reads the
    whole delivery.

    Entries go through `normalize_project_path`, the same predicate the rest of
    the package uses, and unusable ones are dropped rather than passed through:
    one business node naming `/etc/passwd` must not make this node
    undispatchable again.  Normalising before deduping matters because the union
    is a new list that no validator has seen -- `src/x.ts` and `./src/x.ts` each
    pass on their own node and collide here, and
    `authorization._normalize_files` rejects that collision by refusing to
    publish the plan at all.  `allowlist` is an unvalidated channel
    (`DAGNode.__post_init__` only checks for non-empty strings), so this is the
    only place those spellings are caught.

    The union also has to stay inside that validator's 256-item bound, which
    each node's own list respects but their union need not.  Past the bound the
    scope collapses to the distinct top-level directories: a coarser honest
    scope, rather than a truncated one that would quietly hide files from the
    reviewer.

    An empty union returns empty and the caller omits the key, since `"."` is
    not a legal `files` entry.  `append_integration_review_node` handles that
    case by giving the node an explicit `worker_profile` instead.
